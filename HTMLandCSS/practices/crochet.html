      <h2> Let tell a story about how I started crocheting</h2>
        <p> I got in a bad poition I never thought I could be </p>
                <p> It was disrespect for me </p>
                <p> Humilation</p>
                <p> I was hurt</p>
                <p> Broken</p>
                <p> Sleepless nights</p>
                <p>I needed <em> Distraction </em></p>
                <p> Then boom! One day I was scrolling through tiktok, then I saw a lady crocheting</p>
                <p> And that was it</p>
                <p> The start of my crochet journey</p>
                <p> Something that was meant to be a distraction</p>
                <p> Healed me</p>
                <p> Not just healed but became a huge part of me</p>
                <p> Watch Out For blessings even in unfavorable condition</p>
